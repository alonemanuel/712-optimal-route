# Archive

This directory holds old documents that are no longer actively used but kept for reference.

## Contents

### `stack-proposals/`
Initial exploration docs created during tech stack selection (2026-02-20):
- `backend-proposal.md`
- `frontend-proposal.md`
- `devops-proposal.md`
- `design-proposal.md`
- `design-brief.md`
- `design-decisions.md`
- `ux-design-research.md`

These proposals were consolidated into `docs/stack.md` and `docs/architecture.md`. They're archived here for historical reference but should not be read during normal sessions.

### `prd-versions/`
Superseded PRD versions. The current PRD is always `docs/prd.md`. Old versions are moved here when requirements change significantly.

**Note:** This directory is currently empty. It will hold old PRD versions as the project evolves.

## When to Archive

- **Stack proposals** — After the stack is finalized and documented in `docs/stack.md`
- **PRDs** — When creating a new PRD version, move the old one here
- **Large refactors** — If a major architecture change makes old docs obsolete, move them here rather than deleting

## When NOT to Archive

- Working documents (keep in main structure)
- Knowledge that's still relevant (belongs in `knowledge/`)
- Active specs (keep in `specs/`)
